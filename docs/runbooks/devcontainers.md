# Devcontainers

Devcontainers are a feature of Visual Studio Code that enables developers to develop in a containerized environment. Here are the steps to get started with Devcontainers:

1. Install Visual Studio Code
2. Install the Remote Development extension
3. Open a project in Visual Studio Code
4. Click on the green "><" icon in the bottom left corner of the window
5. Select "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container"
6. Wait for the container to build and start
7. Develop as usual within the container

Devcontainers are useful because they enable developers to work in an isolated environment with all the necessary tools and dependencies pre-installed. This can be especially helpful when working with complex applications or in a team setting.
