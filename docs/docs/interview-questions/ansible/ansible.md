# Ansible

## How does Ansible work?

- Ansible is a combination of multiple pieces working together to become an automation tool. Mainly these are modules, playbooks, and plugins.
- Modules are small codes that will get executed. There are multiple inbuilt modules that serve as a starting point for building tasks.
- Playbooks contain plays which further is a group of tasks. This is the place to define the workflow or the steps needed to complete a process
- Plugins are special kinds of modules that run on the main control machine for logging purposes. There are other types of plugins also.
