# Nodes

## What is a node in Kubernetes?

- A node is the smallest fundamental unit of computing hardware.
- It represents a single machine in a cluster, which could be a physical machine in a data center or a virtual machine from a cloud provider.
- Each machine can substitute any other machine in a Kubernetes cluster.
- The master in Kubernetes controls the nodes that have containers.
