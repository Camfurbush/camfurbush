## What is Docker?

- Docker is an open-source platform that allows developers to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. It ensures that the application runs consistently across different environments.

## What is Kubernetes?

- Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It helps manage clusters of containers at scale.

## How are Kubernetes and Docker related

- Docker is an open-source platform/runtime utilizing cgroups to run software in a containerized environment. Its main benefit is that it packages the settings and dependencies that the software/application needs to run into a container, which allows for portability and several other advantages.
- Kubernetes allows for the orchestration and deployment of containers. Kubernetes is typically run on a cluster

## What is Minikube?

- Software that allows you to run a single instance of Kubernetes locally. This allows you to deploy to your local cluster before deploying to a real cluster
