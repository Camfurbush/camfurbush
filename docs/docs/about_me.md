# About Me

My name is Cameron Furbush. I have experience working as a Site Reliability Engineer in both large and small companies. I received a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from the University of West Florida. When I'm not working or focusing on technology, my time has recently been focused on training for a triathlon.
